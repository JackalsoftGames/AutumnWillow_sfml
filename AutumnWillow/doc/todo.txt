Delta2/3/4 satisfy the need of a generic tuple struct class. Refactor?
Is Bithelper128 necessary? Can we extend it somehow?

TickTimer for GAME logic, not system logic
- implement as ushort

TimeStep class for system timing (timer to manage updates)

EXTENSIONS

	- Random extensions for circle, arc, quad, etc

COLLECTIONS

Certain collections, such as Queue<T> and Stack<T> do not implement ICollection<T>. Indexing the values
or viewing the raw array should also be possible, but it isn't. Because calling foreach is less preferable
than polling an array directly, we should create custom classes that perform this behavior. Queue should
be implemented as a rolling array that resizes. Stack should be trivial.

	- TimeStep relies on a Queue

MATHEMATICS
	Constants
	- Float or double? Mathhelper?

	MathHelper
	- Can this be folded into something else? Can we include consts here?
	- float-only helper functions that vectors can use
	- min max clamp, etc

	Interpolation
	Curves
	- Somewhat related
	- Linear, bezier, hermite, etc etc

	Noise
	- Fractals and perlin
	- Trig function noises?

	Linear Algebra
	- Matrix, Quaternion
	- Vector static funcs
