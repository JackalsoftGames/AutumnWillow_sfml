Delta2/3/4 satisfy the need of a generic tuple struct class. Refactor?
Is Bithelper128 necessary? Can we extend it somehow?

TickTimer for GAME logic, not system logic
- implement as ushort?

QUADBATCH
	- Implement sprite sorting for deferred, texture, and FTB and BTF modes
	- We need a vertex[], plus a texture[] and index[]. Since we have 4xN vertices, we
	  need to track the index ordering. We sort the index array and this corresponds to
	  textures or groups of 4 verts... I think

SYSTEM
	TimeStep
	- Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum
	- TargetMin, TargetMax (ticks), Capacity

PARTICLES

EXTENSIONS

	- Random extensions for circle, arc, quad, etc
	- UnitSquare, Triangle, Circle, Sphere, Cube, Cone(?)(3d triangle/wedge)
	- Random quad/barycenter triangle
	- Point on/in unit shapes

	- Vector functions!
	- Normalize, dot, cross, length, length2, length-1

COLLECTIONS

	- Queue<T> and Stack<T> which implement ICollection<T> (redundant?)
	- FlexArray<T>, which resizes automatically (how to handle ext references?)
	- RollingArray<T> (isn't this just a list? why choose this over an array?)
	- Grid<T>, which holds a 2D array of values
	  - Matrix OPs on it (transpose, slice, etc)

MATHEMATICS
	Constants
	- Float or double? Mathhelper?

	MathHelper
	- Can this be folded into something else? Can we include consts here?
	- float-only helper functions that vectors can use
	- min max clamp, etc

	Interpolation
	Curves
	- Somewhat related
	- Linear, bezier, hermite, etc etc

	Noise
	- Fractals and perlin
	- Trig function noises?

	Linear Algebra
	- Matrix, Quaternion
	- Vector static funcs
