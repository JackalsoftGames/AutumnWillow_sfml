# AutumnWillow_sfml

"AutumnWillow_sfml" is the name of the project on GitHub. It contains
both "AutumnWillow" and "Squish".

"Squish" is the containing folder of the Squish Framework, and it is
released under the GNU GPLv3 license. It is a free and open source
library for C#/SFML, which acts as a simple game engine.

"AutumnWillow" is the name of a folder containing code and assets for
a game entitled "Autumn Willow". This project requires C#, SFML, and
the Squish Framework. These code and assets are copyright (C) 2018
Jackalsoft Games, and are NOT covered by the GNU GPLv3 license.

###

The LICENSE file is located in the "Squish" folder. It is structured
this way because if I had two repositories/projects on the go, I
wouldn't be able to manage my project with one .sln file, and it would
quickly become a headache to manage the project and build them rapidly.

Mostly this streamlines the development process for me, and allows me
to release the engine code under a free license.
